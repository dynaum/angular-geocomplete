angular-geocomplete
===================

Simple Angular.js factory that gets GeoData from Google Maps's API with a simple name of a City or an Address.

It returns arrays of data and as much options are available for the query. It has two methods: `cities` and `citiesJSON`.

The first one returns an array with just a String with the following data and format: "City Name, State Name or abbreviature, Country Name".

The second method returns an array with a bunch more data formatted as the Google Maps's API does.

More docs on the code.
